Usage: 

To start nameserver, run the command:

python game.py

This will start a nameserver on your IP address accessible to others.
Once the server is running, a message will be printed to the terminal,
giving the IP address of the now running server.

*** Note: Client should not be attempted to run until the affirmation ***
*** text has been printed to the window running the server.           ***

To connect to this nameserver, run 

python client.py -i [IP]

With the IP being the IP address of the host containing the nameserver.

*** Note: The client will not work with a terminal screen that is too  ***
*** small.  We have added a command that should change the window size ***
*** to 200 x 60.  This seems to work on Macs, but not windows.  If	   ***
*** the screen does not increase as expected, we reccomend increasing  *** 
*** the terminal screen to dimensions of 200 x 60.					   ***

Use WASD controls to move the fish through the ocean and enjoy!
